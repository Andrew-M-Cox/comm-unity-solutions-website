<p class="lead">Effective stewardship communication invites generosity without feeling transactional. Here's how to craft messages that inspire giving.</p>

<h2>Focus on Impact</h2>
<p>Instead of asking for money, communicate the impact of generosity. Share stories of how giving transforms lives and communities.</p>

<h2>Language That Resonates</h2>
<p>Use language that connects giving to your mission and values. Frame stewardship as a form of participation in your shared work.</p>

<h2>Transparency and Trust</h2>
<p>Be transparent about how funds are used. Regular updates on the impact of giving build trust and encourage continued generosity.</p>
