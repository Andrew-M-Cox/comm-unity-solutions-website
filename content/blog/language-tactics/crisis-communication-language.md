<p class="lead">Crisis communication requires special attention to language that offers compassion, transparency, and hope.</p>

<h2>Compassion First</h2>
<p>Lead with compassion. Acknowledge pain, uncertainty, and the impact of difficult situations on your community.</p>

<h2>Transparency</h2>
<p>Be transparent about what you know, what you don't know, and what you're doing to address the situation. Trust is built through honesty.</p>

<h2>Hope Without Minimizing</h2>
<p>Offer hope without minimizing the reality of the situation. Acknowledge difficulty while pointing toward ways forward.</p>

<h2>Clear Action Steps</h2>
<p>Provide clear information about what comes next. Uncertainty is hard; clarity helps, even when the path forward is difficult.</p>
