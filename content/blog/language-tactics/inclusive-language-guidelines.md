<p class="lead">Inclusive language welcomes all members of your community and honors diverse identities and experiences.</p>

<h2>Principles of Inclusive Language</h2>
<p>Use language that is welcoming, respectful, and acknowledges the diversity of your community. Avoid assumptions about gender, ability, or background.</p>

<h2>Gender-Inclusive Language</h2>
<p>Use gender-neutral or expansive language when possible. Avoid defaulting to masculine language or assuming gender roles.</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>Use clear, accessible language that welcomes people of all abilities and backgrounds. Avoid jargon and explain terms when necessary.</p>

<h2>Ongoing Learning</h2>
<p>Language evolves, and so should your guidelines. Stay open to feedback and continuous learning about inclusive communication.</p>
