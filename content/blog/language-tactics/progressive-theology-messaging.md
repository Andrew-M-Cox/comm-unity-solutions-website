<p class="lead">Articulating progressive theological perspectives requires clarity, accessibility, and authenticity.</p>

<h2>Making Complex Ideas Accessible</h2>
<p>Break down complex theological concepts into accessible language. Use metaphors, stories, and examples that resonate with diverse audiences.</p>

<h2>Honoring Diverse Perspectives</h2>
<p>Progressive theology often involves acknowledging multiple perspectives. Communicate in ways that honor diverse viewpoints while maintaining your core values.</p>

<h2>Authentic Voice</h2>
<p>Don't water down your theology, but do communicate it in ways that invite rather than exclude. Authenticity matters more than perfection.</p>
