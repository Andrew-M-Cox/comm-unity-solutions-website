<p class="lead">Every great communication strategy begins with a clear vision. For progressive churches and faith-based organizations, this vision must align with your mission, values, and the communities you serve.</p>

<h2>Why a Communication Vision Matters</h2>
<p>Your communication vision serves as the North Star for all your messaging, campaigns, and engagement efforts. It helps ensure consistency across channels and aligns your team around shared goals.</p>

<h2>Key Elements of a Communication Vision</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Your Mission:</strong> How does communication serve your broader organizational mission?</li>
  <li><strong>Your Audience:</strong> Who are you communicating with, and what do they need to hear?</li>
  <li><strong>Your Values:</strong> What principles guide your communication style and messaging?</li>
  <li><strong>Your Goals:</strong> What outcomes do you want your communication to achieve?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Start by gathering key stakeholders—staff, leadership, and active volunteers—for a visioning session. Use facilitated conversations to explore what communication means to your organization and how it supports your mission.</p>

<p>Document your vision in a clear, accessible format that your team can reference regularly. Make it visible in your workspace and revisit it during strategic planning sessions.</p>
