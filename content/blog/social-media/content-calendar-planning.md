<p class="lead">A content calendar helps you maintain consistency and balance your messaging across themes and seasons.</p>

<h2>Planning Ahead</h2>
<p>Plan content around your church calendar, liturgical seasons, and community events. This helps you stay organized and relevant.</p>

<h2>Content Mix</h2>
<p>Balance different types of content: inspirational, educational, community-focused, and advocacy. Vary your formats too—text, images, videos.</p>

<h2>Flexibility</h2>
<p>Leave room for spontaneous content that responds to current events or community needs. Your calendar should guide, not constrain.</p>
