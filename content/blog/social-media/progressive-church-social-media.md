<p class="lead">Building an authentic social media presence that reflects your progressive values requires intention and strategy.</p>

<h2>Authentic Voice</h2>
<p>Your social media should sound like your church—not generic or corporate. Share your unique perspective and values authentically.</p>

<h2>Community Engagement</h2>
<p>Social media is about building community, not just broadcasting. Respond to comments, ask questions, and create space for dialogue.</p>

<h2>Balancing Content</h2>
<p>Mix worship content, community highlights, social justice advocacy, and everyday moments. Show the full picture of your church community.</p>
